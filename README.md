## Hi there 👋


Data Analyst and Computer Science Student at Alexandria University (Class of 2028) I have a deep passion for exploring data and translating complex numbers into clear, actionable stories that drive growth.
Through my intensive training at Route Academy, I have mastered a wide range of technical tools including SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. I also specialize in advanced techniques like Web Scraping, Statistics, and R programming, alongside modern skills such as Prompt Engineering and UI/UX design using Figma. I enjoy the challenge of gathering raw data from the web and cleaning it to build meaningful models.
My practical experience includes building several end-to-end projects, such as a comprehensive Sales Dashboard, an Airline Data Analysis system, and a specialized project for Adidas. One of my favorite challenges was using Python to scrape and analyze data for the Africa Cup of Nations, which allowed me to combine my technical skills with real-world sports data. I am always looking for opportunities to apply my expertise in Python, SQL, and Data Visualization to solve business problems and deliver high-quality insights.
